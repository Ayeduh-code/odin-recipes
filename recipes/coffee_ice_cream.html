        <h2>A coffe lover's dream. Rich, creamy, and sweet balanced perfectly with the bitter of coffee</h2>

        <p>Got this recipe from a friend and modified scaled down to a pint (which is 1 cup of liquid without churning).
            Substituted vanilla bean paste for extract to deepen the vanilla flavor and give it some personality.
