        <h2>A rich but earthy cheesecake that is a delight to the tastebuds</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one that I took from a site online and tweaked when I messed up preparing it originally.
            The consistency is a bit more loose than the japanese cheesecake but less dense than a New York Cheescake
            Overall, the cheesecake went over well and it was a good learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>If you are looking for a cheesecake that is more matcha flavor than other matcha cheesecakes 
            you've tried, then this recipe is for you.</p>
